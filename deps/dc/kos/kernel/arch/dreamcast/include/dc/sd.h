    \brief  Block-level access to an SD card attached to the SCIF port.

    This file contains the interface to working with the SD card reader that was
    designed by jj1odm. The SD card reader itself connects to the SCIF port and
    uses it basically as a simple SPI bus.

    For reference, all I/O through this code should be done in the order of SD
    card blocks (which are 512 bytes a piece). Also, this should adequately
    support SD and SDHC cards (and possibly SDXC, but I don't have any of them
    to try out).

    This code doesn't directly implement any filesystems on top of the SD card,
    but rather provides you with direct block-level access. This probably will
    not be useful to most people in its current form (without a filesystem), but
    this will provide you with all of the building blocks you should need to
    actually make it work for you.

    Due to the patent-encumbered nature of certain parts of the FAT32
    filesystem, that filesystem will likely never be supported in KOS proper
    (unless, of course, people are still using KOS after those patents expire).
    I'm not going to encourage anyone to violate Microsoft's patents on FAT32
    and I'm not going to be the enabler for anyone to do so either. So, if you
    want FAT32, you're on your own.

/** \brief  Calculate a SD/MMC-style CRC over a block of data.

    This function calculates a 7-bit CRC over a given block of data. The
    polynomial of this CRC is x^7 + x^3 + 1. The CRC is shifted into the upper
    7 bits of the return value, so bit 0 should always be 0.

    \param  data            The block of data to calculate the CRC over.
    \param  size            The number of bytes in the block of data.
    \param  crc             The starting value of the calculation. If you're
                            passing in a full block, this will probably be 0.
    \return                 The calculated CRC.

    This function initializes the SD card for first use. This includes all steps
    of the basic initialization sequence for SPI mode, as documented in the SD
    card spec and at http://elm-chan.org/docs/mmc/mmc_e.html . This also will
    call scif_sd_init() for you, so you don't have to worry about that ahead of
    time.

                            problems, but probably means that no SD card was
                            detected.
