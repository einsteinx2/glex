    \brief  Low-level sound support and memory management.

    This file contains declarations for low-level sound operations and for SPU
    RAM pool memory management. Most of the time you'll be better off using the
    higher-level functionality in the sound effect support or streaming support,
    but this stuff can be very useful for some things.

/** \brief  Allocate memory in the SPU RAM pool

    This function acts as the memory allocator for the SPU RAM pool. It acts
    much like one would expect a malloc() function to act, although it does not
    return a pointer directly, but rather an offset in SPU RAM.

    \param  size            The amount of memory to allocate, in bytes.
    \return                 The location of the start of the block on success,
                            or 0 on failure.

    This function returns the largest size that can be currently passed to
    snd_mem_malloc() and expected to not return failure. There may be more
    memory available in the pool, especially if multiple blocks have been
    allocated and freed, but calls to snd_mem_malloc() for larger blocks will
    return failure, since the memory is not available contiguously.

    \return                 The size of the largest available block of memory in

    make sure any packet can fit.

                            been corrupted, and thus should be reinitialized.
