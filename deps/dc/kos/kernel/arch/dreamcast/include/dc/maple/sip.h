    \brief  Definitions for using the Sound Input Peripheral.

    This file contains the definitions needed to access the Maple microphone
    type device (the Seaman mic). Many thanks go out to ZeZu who pointed me
    toward what some of the commands actually do in the original version of this
    driver.

    As a note, the device itself is actually referred to by the system as the
    Sound Input Peripheral, so hence why this driver is named as it is.

/** \brief  Type for a microphone sample callback.

    This is the signature that is required for a function to accept samples
    from the microphone as it is sampling. This function will be called about
    once per frame, and in an interrupt context (so it should be pretty quick
    to execute). Basically, all you should do in one of these is copy the
    samples out to your own buffer -- do not do any processing on the samples
    in your callback other than to copy them out!

    \param  dev             The device the samples are coming from.
    \param  samples         Pointer to the sample buffer.
    \param  len             The number of bytes in the sample buffer.

    any of this, especially while the microphone is sampling could really screw
