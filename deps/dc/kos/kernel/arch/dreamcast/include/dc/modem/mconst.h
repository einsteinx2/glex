/** \file   dc/modem/mconst.h
    \brief  Constants used in the modem driver.

    This file contains constants that are used for the modem driver. You should
    not ever need to include this file directly, as the main modem driver header
    file includes it automatically.

    Generally, you will not need to use the stuff in this file yourself at all,
    as the main modem header file defines many useful combinations for you.

/* Each speed constant contains information about the data rate in bps and the
   protocol that's being used. The first 4 bits identify the the speed that's
   being used, and the last 4 bits identify the protocol.

   And don't try to create your own custom speeds from these, you'll cause
   something very bad to happen. Only use the MODEM_SPEED_* constants defined
   in modem.h! */

/** \defgroup   modem_speeds    Modem speed values

    This group defines the available speed values that are able to be used with
    the Dreamcast's modem. The actual speed value consists of one of these in
    the lower 4 bits and one of the protocols in the upper 4 bits. Don't try to
    use any speeds not defined here, as bad things may happen.

    It should be fairly obvious from the names what the speeds are (they're all
    expressed in bits per second).
