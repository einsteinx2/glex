    \brief  G1 bus ATA interface.

    This file provides support for accessing an ATA device on the G1 bus in the
    Dreamcast. The G1 bus usually contains a few useful pieces of the system,
    including the flashrom and the GD-ROM drive. The interesting piece here is
    that the GD-ROM drive itself is actually an ATA device.

    Luckily, Sega left everything in place to access both a master and slave
    device on this ATA port. The GD-ROM drive should always be the master device
    on the chain, but you can hook up a hard drive or some other device as a
    slave. The functions herein are for accessing just such a slave device.

    \note   The functions herein do not provide for direct access to the GD-ROM
            drive. There is not really any sort of compelling reason to access
            the GD-ROM drive directly instead of using the system calls, so you
            should continue to use the normal cdrom_* functions for accessing
            the GD-ROM drive. Also, currently there is no locking done to
            prevent you from doing "bad things" with concurrent access on the
            bus, so be careful. ;)

/** \defgroup ata_devices           ATA device definitions

    The constants here represent the valid values that can be set as the active
    device on the ATA bus. You should pass one of these values to the
    g1_ata_select_device() function to select the appropriate device.

    \note   Many times, the value returned by the g1_ata_select_device()
            function will have other bits set than the constants below. You
            should AND the value returned from that function with 0x10 if you
            really need to know what device is actually selected. If the value
            returned is true when ANDed with 0x10, then the slave device was
            selected, otherwise the master device was. The other bits are either
            command-specific or are reserved for compatibility sake.

/** \brief  ATA master device.

    This constant selects the master device on the ATA bus. This is normally the
    GD-ROM drive.

    \note   The GD-ROM really does not like the reserved bits being set in the
            device select register, hence why this constant doesn't select them.
            Some hard drives may require them, however. If you find one that
            does, then you should use the \ref G1_ATA_MASTER_ALT constant to
            access it if it is the master device on the bus.
