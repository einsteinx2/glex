    \brief  Stack traces.

    The functions in this file deal with doing stack traces. These functions
    will do a stack trace, as specified, printing it out to stdout (usually a
    dcload terminal). These functions only work if frame pointers have been
    enabled at compile time (-DFRAME_POINTERS and no -fomit-frame-pointer flag).

/** \brief  Do a stack trace from the current function.

    This function does a stack trace from the current function, printing the
    results to stdout. This is used, for instance, when an assertion fails in
    assert().

    \param  n               The number of frames to leave off. Each frame is a
                            jump to subroutine or branch to subroutine. assert()
                            leaves off 2 frames, for reference.
