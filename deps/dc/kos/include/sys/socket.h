    This file contains the standard definitions (as directed by the POSIX 2008
    spec) for socket-related functionality in the AF_INET and AF_INET6 address
    families. This does not include anything related to UNIX domain sockets
    and is not guaranteed to have everything that one might have in a
    fully-standards compliant implementation of the POSIX spec.
