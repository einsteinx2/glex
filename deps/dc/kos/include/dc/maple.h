    \brief  Maple Bus driver interface.

    This file provides support for accessing the Maple bus on the Dreamcast.
    Maple is the bus that all of your controllers and memory cards and the like
    connect to, so this is one of those types of things that are quite important
    to know how to use.

    Each peripheral device registers their driver within this system, and can be
    accessed through the functions here. Most of the drivers have their own
    functionality that is implemented in their header files, as well.
