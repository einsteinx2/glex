    \brief  Definitions for using the Dreameye Camera device.

    This file contains the definitions needed to access the Maple Camera type
    device (aka, the Dreameye). Currently, this driver allows you to download
    the still pictures that are saved on the camera and delete them. It does not
    allow you to use the camera for video input currently.
