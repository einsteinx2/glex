/** \file   kos/fs.h
    \brief  Virtual filesystem support.

    This file contains the interface to the virtual filesystem (VFS) of KOS. The
    functions defined in this file make up the base of the filesystem operations
    that can be performed by programs. The functions in here are abstracted by
    various other layers in libc, and shouldn't be necessarily used (for
    portability reasons). However, if you want only to interact with KOS in your
    programs, feel free to use them to your heart's content!
