    \brief  Condition variables.

    This file contains the definition of a Condition Variable. Condition
    Variables (or condvars for short) are used with a mutex to act as a lock and
    checkpoint pair for threads.

    Basically, things work as follows (for the thread doing work):
    \li The associated mutex is locked.
    \li A predicate is checked to see if it is safe to do something.
    \li If it is not safe, you call cond_wait(), which releases the mutex.
    \li When cond_wait() returns, the mutex is reaquired, and work can go on.
    \li Update any predicates so that we konw that the work is done, and unlock
        the mutex.

    Meanwhile, the thread updating the condition works as follows:
    \li Lock the mutex associated with the condvar.
    \li Produce work to be done.
    \li Call cond_signal() (with the associated mutex still locked), so that any
        threads waiting on the condvar will know they can continue on when the
        mutex is released, also update any predicates that say whether work can
        be done.
    \li Unlock the mutex so that worker threads can acquire the mutex and do
        whatever work needs to be done.

    Condition variables can be quite useful when used properly, and provide a
    fairly easy way to wait for work to be ready to be done.

    Condition variables should never be used with mutexes that are of the type
    MUTEX_TYPE_RECURSIVE. The lock will only be released once by the wait
    function, and thus you will end up deadlocking if you use a recursive mutex
    that has been locked more than once.
