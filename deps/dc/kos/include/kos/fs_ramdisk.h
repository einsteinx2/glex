/** \file   kos/fs_ramdisk.h
    \brief  RAM-based virtual file system.

    This file contains support for a ramdisk VFS. This VFS allows you to map
    memory into files that will appear in /ram. Files in this VFS can grow as
    large as memory allows, and there is full read/write support here. This is
    useful, for (for instance) cacheing files read from the CD-ROM or for making
    temporary files.

    You only have one ramdisk available, and its mounted on /ram.

/** \brief  Attach a block of memory as a file in the ramdisk.

    This function takes a block of memory and associates it with a file on the
    ramdisk. This memory should be allocated with malloc(), as an unlink() of
    the file will call free on the block of memory. The ramdisk then effectively
    takes control of the block, and is responsible for it at that point.
