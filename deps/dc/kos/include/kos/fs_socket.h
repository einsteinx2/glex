/** \file   kos/fs_socket.h
    \brief  Definitions for a sockets "filesystem".

    This file provides definitions to support the BSD-sockets-like filesystem
    in KallistiOS. Technically, this filesystem mounts itself on /sock, but it
    doesn't export any files there, so that point is largely irrelevant. The
    filesystem is designed to be extensible, making it possible to add
    additional socket family handlers at runtime. Currently, the kernel only
    implements UDP sockets over IPv4 and IPv6, but as mentioned, this can be
    extended in a fairly straightforward manner. In general, as a user of
    KallistiOS (someone not interested in adding additional socket family
    drivers), there's very little in this file that will be of interest.
