/** \file   kos/recursive_lock.h
    \brief  Definitions for a recursive mutex.

    This file defines a recursive lock mechanism, similar to a mutex, but that a
    single thread can obtain as many times as it wants. A single thread is still
    limited to holding the lock at a time, but it can hold it an "unlimited"
    number of times (actually limited to INT_MAX, but who's counting).

    These are now just wrappers around the MUTEX_TYPE_RECURSIVE that is now
    provided and will be removed at some point in the future. Please update your
    code to use that type instead.
