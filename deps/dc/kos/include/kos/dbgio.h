    \brief  Debug I/O.

    This file contains the Debug I/O system, which abstracts things so that
    various types of debugging tools can be used by programs in KOS. Included
    among these tools is the dcload console (dcload-serial, dcload-ip, and
    fs_dclsocket), a raw serial console, and a framebuffer based console.

/** \brief  Debug I/O Interface.

    This struct represents a single dbgio interface. This should represent
    a generic pollable console interface. We will store an ordered list of
    these statically linked into the program and fall back from one to the
    next until one returns true for detected(). Note that the last device in
    this chain is the null console, which will always return true.
