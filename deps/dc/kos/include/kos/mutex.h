    \brief  Mutual exclusion locks.

    This file defines mutual exclusion locks (or mutexes for short). The concept
    of a mutex is one of the most common types of locks in a multi-threaded
    environment. Mutexes do exactly what they sound like, they keep two (or
    more) threads mutually exclusive from one another. A mutex is used around
    a block of code to prevent two threads from interfereing with one another
    when only one would be appropriate to be in the block at a time.

    KallistiOS implments 3 types of mutexes, to bring it roughly in-line with
    POSIX. The types of mutexes that can be made are normal, error-checking, and
    recursive. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, which are briefly
    discussed below.

    A normal mutex (MUTEX_TYPE_NORMAL) is the fastest and simplest mutex of the
    bunch. This is roughly equivalent to a semaphore that has been initialized
    with a count of 1. There is no protection against threads unlocking normal
    mutexes they didn't lock, nor is there any protection against deadlocks that
    would arise from locking the mutex twice.

    An error-checking mutex (MUTEX_TYPE_ERRORCHECK) adds a small amount of error
    checking on top of a normal mutex. This type will not allow you to lock the
    mutex twice (it will return an error if the same thread tries to lock it two
    times so it will not deadlock), and it will not allow a different thread to
    unlock the mutex if it isn't the one holding the lock.

    A recursive mutex (MUTEX_TYPE_RECURSIVE) extends the error checking mutex
    by allowing you to lock the mutex twice in the same thread, but you must
    also unlock it twice (this works for any number of locks -- lock it n times,
    you must unlock it n times). Still only one thread can hold the lock, but it
    may hold it as many times as it needs to. This is equivalent to the
    recursive_lock_t type that was available in KallistiOS for a while (before
    it was basically merged back into a normal mutex).

    There is a fourth type of mutex defined (MUTEX_TYPE_DEFAULT), which maps to
    the MUTEX_TYPE_NORMAL type. This is simply for alignment with POSIX.
