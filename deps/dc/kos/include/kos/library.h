/** \file   kos/library.h
    \brief  Dynamically loadable library support.

    This file contains definitions for accessing loadable libraries at runtime.
    Each library has a name and a version number that it can be referenced by.
    One must be careful with these dynamic libraries as there is no private
    storage per instance, and all memory space is shared.

    Libraries can both export and import symbols. Imported symbols may require
    other libraries to be loaded earlier. Libraries are reference counted so
    that they can be opened multiple times without actually loading them
    multiple times, and so that a close will act as expected in situations like
    this.
