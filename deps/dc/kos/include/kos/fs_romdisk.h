/** \file   kos/fs_romdisk.h
    \brief  ROMFS virtual file system.

    This file contains support for the romdisk VFS. This VFS allows you to make
    Linux-style ROMFS images and either embed them into your binary or load them
    at runtime from some other source (such as a CD-ROM). These images are made
    with the genromfs program that is included in the utils portion of the tree.

    You can choose to automount one ROMFS image by embedding it into your binary
    and using the appropriate KOS_INIT_FLAGS() setting. The embedded ROMFS will
    mount itself on /rom. You can also mount additional images that you load
    from some other source on whatever mountpoint you want.

    so make sure that all files have been closed before calling it. If the VFS
