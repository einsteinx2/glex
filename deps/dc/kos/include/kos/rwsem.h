    \brief  Definition for a reader/writer semaphore.

    This file defines a concept of reader/writer semaphores. Basically, this
    type of lock allows an unlimited number of "readers" to acquire the lock at
    a time, but only one "writer" (and only if no readers hold the lock).
    Readers, by definition, should not change any global data (since they are
    defined to only be reading), and since this is the case it is safe to allow
    multiple readers to access global data that is shared amongst threads.
    Writers on the other hand require exclusive access since they will be
    changing global data in the critical section, and they cannot share with
    a reader either (since the reader might attempt to read while the writer is
    changing data).
