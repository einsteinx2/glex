    \brief  C11 threading functionality.

    This file contains the definitions needed for using C11 threads. The C11
    standard defines a number of threading-related primitives, which we wrap
    neatly around KOS' built-in threading support here.

    If you compile your code with a strict standard set (you use a -std= flag
    with GCC that doesn't start with gnu), you must use -std=c11 to use this
    functionality. If you don't pass a -std= flag to GCC, then you're probably
    fine.
