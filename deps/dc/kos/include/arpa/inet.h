    This function, much like inet_addr, converts a string representation of an
    IPv4 address to a binary representation. This function, however, is
    non-standard (but seems to appear a lot of places). This function is a
    little nicer to work with than inet_addr simply because of the fact that the
    error return from inet_addr happens to actually correspond to a real IPv4
    address (255.255.255.255). This version actually distinguishes between that
    address and invalid addresses.

/** \brief  Convert a string representation of an IP address to its binary
            representation.

    This function, like inet_addr, converts a string representation of an IP
    address to its binary representation. This function, unlike inet_aton, is
    actually standard (in POSIX 2008), and operates very similarly. The only
    differences between this function and inet_aton are that this function does
    not support hexadecimal or octal representations and that this function has
    the ability to support IPv6. This is the function that you should actually
    use to convert addresses from strings to binary in new code, rather than
    inet_addr or inet_aton.

    \param  af              The address family that src is an address in. The
                            only supported values are AF_INET and AF_INET6.
    \param  src             A string representation of the address.
    \param  dst             Storage for the result. For AF_INET, this must be at
                            least 32-bits in size (the function treats it as a
                            struct in_addr). For AF_INET6, this must be at least
                            128-bits in size (the function treats it as a struct
                            in6_addr).
    \retval -1              af is unsupported.
    \retval 0               An invalid address was given.

/** \brief  Convert a binary representation of an IP address to a string.

    This function does the exact oposite of the inet_pton function, converting
    a binary form of an address to a string. This function, unlike inet_ntoa, is
    reentrant, and is the function that you should generally use if you need to
    convert a binary representation of an IP address to a string.

    \param  af              The address family that src is in. The only
                            supported values are AF_INET and AF_INET6.
    \param  src             A binary representation of an IP address.
    \param  dst             Storage for the resulting string. This string should
                            be at least 16-bytes long for IPv4, and 46 bytes for
                            IPv6.
    \param  size            The length of dst.
    \retval NULL            Upon failed conversion.
    \retval dst             Upon successful conversion.

    This function does the exact opposite of the inet_addr function, converting
    a binary form of an address to a string. This function, unlike inet_ntop
    is non-reentrant (not thread-safe), and will always only support IPv4
    addresses. It is suggested to use inet_ntop in any new code.
