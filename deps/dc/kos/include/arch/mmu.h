    \brief  Memory Management Unit and Translation Lookaside Buffer handling.

    This file defines the interface to the Memory Management Unit (MMU) in the
    SH4. The MMU, while not used normally by KOS, is available for virtual
    memory use, if you so desire. While using this functionality is probably
    overkill for most homebrew, there are a few very interesting things that
    this functionality could be used for (like mapping large files into memory
    that wouldn't otherwise fit).

    The whole system is set up as a normal paged memory virtual->physical
    address translation. KOS implements the page table as a sparse, two-level
    page table. By default, pages are 4KB in size. Each top-level page table
    entry has 512 2nd level entries (there are 1024 entries in the top-level
    entry). This works out to about 2KB of space needed for one top-level entry.

    The SH4 itself has 4 TLB entries for instruction fetches, and 64 "unified"
    TLB entries (for combined instructions + data). Essentially, the UTLB acts
    both as the TLB for data accesses (from mov instructions) and as a cache for
    entries for the ITLB. If there is no entry in the ITLB for an instruction
    access, the UTLB will automatically be searched. If no entry is found still,
    an ITLB miss exception will be generated. Data accesses are handled
    similarly to this (although additional complications are involved due to
    write accesses, and of course the ITLB doesn't play into data accesses).

    For more information about how the MMU works, refer to the Hitachi/Renesas
    SH4 programming manual. It has much more detailed information than what is
    in here, for obvious reasons.

    This functionality was ported over to mainline KOS from the KOS-MMU project
    of Dan Potter. Unfortunately, KOS-MMU never reached a real phase of maturity
    and usefulness, but this piece can be quite useful on its own.

/* Since the software has to handle TLB misses on the SH-4, we have freedom
   to use any page table format we want (and thus save space), but we must
   make it quick to access. The SH-4 can address a maximum of 512M of address
   space per "area", but we only care about one area, so this is the total
   maximum addressable space. With 4K pages, that works out to 2^17 pages
   that must be mappable, or 17 bits. We use 18 bits just to be sure (there
   are a few left over).

   Page tables (per-process) are a sparse two-level array. The virtual address
   space is actually 2^30 bytes, or 2^(30-12)=2^18 pages, so there must be
   a possibility of having that many page entries per process space. A full
   page table for a process would be 1M, so this is obviously too big!! Thus
   the sparse array.

   The bottom layer of the page tables consists of a sub-context array for
   512 pages, which translates into 2K of storage space. The process then
   has the possibility of using one or more of the 512 top-level slots. For
   a very small process (using one page for code/data and one for stack), it
   should be possible to achieve a page table footprint of one page. The tables
   can grow from there as neccessary.

   Virtual addresses are broken up as follows:

   Bits 31 - 22     10 bits top-level page directory
   Bits 21 - 13     9 bits bottom-level page entry
   Bits 11 - 0      Byte index into page
