    for any future allocations.

    \param  ptr             A pointer to the block of memory to be freed.

/** \brief  Change the size of a previously allocated block of memory.

    This function changes the size of the previously allocated block of memory
    from its current size to the specified size. This may involve reallocating
    and copying the data from the original pointer to a new location in memory.

    If this function returns non-NULL, the old pointer is considered invalid and
    should not be used (unless, of course, the returned pointer is the same as
    the old pointer). No action is needed to clean up the old pointer, as this
    function will have freed it if necessary.

    If this function returns NULL, the old pointer is still valid and has not
    had its size changed.

    \param  ptr             A pointer to the block of memory to resize. It must
                            have been previously allocated by way of one of the
                            memory allocation functions in this file (or must
                            be NULL).
    \param  size            The requested size of the new block of memory.
    \return                 A pointer to the newly allocted/resized block of
                            memory on success, or NULL on failure.

    \note                   If ptr is NULL on a call to this function, the
                            function acts the same as malloc(size).
    \note                   If ptr is non-NULL and size is zero, this function
                            *does not* free the block of memory -- it simply
                            returns a block that is of minimal size. By the
                            standard, this pointer must not be dereferenced.

/** \brief  Allocate a block of memory aligned to a specified block size.

    This function allocates a block of memory such that the lowest address in

    instance, for things like DMA that require aligned blocks of memory to work.

    Over-reliance on memalign will most certainly cause memory fragmentation, so
    you should only use it when it is actually necessary.

    \param  alignment       The alignment requested for the block of memory.
                            This must be a power-of-two.

                            blocks aligned on 8-byte boundaries. There is no
                            reason to call this function if you need less than
