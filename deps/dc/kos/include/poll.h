/** \file   poll.h
    \brief  Definitions for the poll() function.

    This file contains the definitions needed for using the poll() function, as
    directed by the POSIX 2008 standard (aka The Open Group Base Specifications
    Issue 7). Currently the functionality defined herein only works for sockets,
    and that is likely how it will stay for some time.

    The poll() function works quite similarly to the select() function that it
    is quite likely that you'd be more familiar with.

/** \brief  Poll a group of file descriptors for activity.

    This function will poll a group of file descriptors to check for the events
    specified on them. The function shall block for the specified period of time
    (in milliseconds) waiting for an event to occur. The function shall return
    as soon as at least one fd matches the events specified (or one of the error
    conditions), or when timeout expires.

    \param  fds         The file descriptors to check, and what events to look
                        for on each.
    \param  nfds        Number of elements in fds.
    \param  timeout     Maximum amount of time to block, in milliseconds. Pass
                        0 to ensure the function does not block and -1 to block
                        for an "infinite" amount of time, until an event occurs.
    \return             -1 on error (sets errno as appropriate), or the number
                        of file descriptors that matched the event flags before
                        the function returns.
